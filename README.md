3D mesh painter

TODO
--------
* refactor duplicate code from mesh-render/bake-render shaders
* bake on camera move (if dirty)
* keep from painting on one panel if other dirty
* remove floating gl* references, use inheritance instead
* optimization: create paint FBO only when needed
* show correct paint color for overlay brush
* allow adjusting brush size
